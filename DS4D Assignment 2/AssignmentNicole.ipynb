Unfortunately, it turned out that the data set regarding the system usage delivered, did not include the required information, but other interesting findings were made. With data about 695 patients (including the 99 users of the system) and a log of the systems usage of 9 months, it includes information about which user engages in which activity. By combining the usage data set with the user data set, it was possible to connect more personal information such as the age and condition to the online activities. \n",

    "From [E4](#e4)'s median, we see that half of the users are over 79 years old. This means, only a small number of users can be considered tech savvy. This leads to the question if there is a difference between the usage of the system in users of different age groups. Through natural bias, we expected to see that younger users engage more in the entertainment system. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this plot shows that the usage is evenly distributed across the age groups. The different link types that belong to the internet or the application have been summarised to show a the plot. It is visible that both systems are used and that the Internet tools are clicked more often than the app services. However, both lines seem parallel, therefore, the ration of older and younger people per system is the same. \n",

    "[Corresponding Plot Deeper Analysis 4.](#D4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot of patients who require elderly support show a slightly different graph. The engagement stays steady from the morning on until the afternoon and rises sharply after 9pm. This might indicate that the system is used for leisure, which might be in the afternoon after lunch and in the evening after dinner. Interestingly, a similar progress can be seen in the following two plots, as the graphs for users over 60 shows a similar plot. \n",
    "As we have seen before, two thirds of the patients in elderly care are female. Therefore, a similar usage movement is indicated in the bottom plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although elderly people seemed to have larger spiked in the usage, it can be seen that people older than 90 engage very little with the system and that usually steadily during the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis should be tested with further normalised numerical values. It would take away a certain bias to calculate an average usage time for each user and compare that with users with other disabilities. However, as mentioned in the beginning, this data set does not allow for a calculation of usage times. Therefore, a correspondence with the data host will be necessary.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are interested in how users interact with the system, it is necessary to analyse when it is used. The plot D3 shows that users start using it in the morning. The steady increase could be caused by people getting up at different times in the day. \n",
    "There are three major drops visible. One around noon, one around 4:40pm to 8pm with a slight rise in between and a drop after 10pm. This can be explained by typical routine activities such as lunch, afternoon tea/dinner and socialising and bedtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, some conditions show characteristics in their plot in D4. The first plot shows the different conditions. A number of conditions show strong spikes, which means that many users with that disability use the system at the same time. \n",
    "For Cerebral Palsy, a spectrum of permanent movement disorders, the activity increases around midday, slightly at 3pm and after dinner. This might indicate boredom around that time, but could also indicate that patients are engaging in the same activity togethe as part of therapy. Similarily, the line for eplileptic users shows a sharp spike in the afternoon around 5pm. Interestingly, the male graph in the third plot shows a similar spike at the same time. However, this interpretation lacks information about the therapy that users engage in and allows other interpretation such as the regualr watching of a TV show. To confirm this hypothesis, consultation with a caretaker would be required as to how the lifestly correlates to the condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, more information about the routine in care homes is needed to be accurate. To further test this hypothesis, the usage for each home should be checked individually. The values should be normalised by an average to make the comparison less biased.\n",

    "## 3. Users engage with the system less often during summer.\n",
    "[Corresponding Plot Exploratory Analysis E3](#E3)\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot E3 compares the number of interactions per day and month. The plot that shows monthly interactions seems to have a strong decrease in the month of March. However, this is due to the scale of the y-Axis. In fact, the values have a variation of 3000 interactions, which is less significant than expected, but indicated a drop in usage in the months of February/March and June/July. This could show that patients engage in alternative activities, maybe outdoor during summer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test the hypothesis further, the usage in hours should be calculated and normalised for each user. Again, this requires correspondence with the data host. It might make sense to compare different seasons or create a heatmap with the average usage time. In other words, more targeted visualisation will be helpful to proof it. \n",

    "\n",
    "From the first overview, we know that there are nearly twice as many female patients as male ones. As mentiones above, D1 shows that two thirds of elderly support patients are female. This explains the larger number of female users in plot D4, which shows the difference in the number of interactions between female and male users. We can see that female users start earlier in the morning and have more interaction in the evening. \n",
